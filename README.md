# Welcome to the Superpedestrian Android Technical Assessment!

## What we will provide you
 - This template project. 
 	- This project provides you sample JSON and a movie model
 - The provided movie model contains basic information about a movie. Things like title, list of actors, plot description, url to a movie poster, year of release, etc.
 - At the time of the interview, we will provide you a document that details the UI element we would like you to build

## Expectations
 - Prior to the meeting, pull down the template project and become familiar with what is provided
	 - If you need anything clarified please reach out and ask!
 - Please ensure you can successfully compile the project
	 - If you run into any issues, please reach out
 - The template project is a template!
	 - feel free to modify, delete, or add anything
		 - we want you to use any tool/technology that you are comfortable with
	 - The goal of the template project is to get you up and running as fast as possible
 - Feel free to make your own changes to the template project
	 - At the time of our meeting let us know what you changed and why!
 - This is an open book assessment
	 - During the exercise feel free to use google or any kind of documentation
		 - every developer uses google ðŸ˜‰

## During the exercise
 - Think out loud!
	 - We want to get a feel for how you work
 - Ask questions!
	 - We are here to help you succeed
 - There are no trick questions or traps
 - Do not get bogged down in architectural details
	 - we want to see how you build adaptive UI

## Expected Outcome
 - You are expected to take a model and build a single view that represents a movie
	 - your view's height should adapt to the size of the strings and image in the movie model
	 - your view's width will be the entire width of your simulator or android device
	 - your views overall size and appearance is expected to change with different movies
 - If a movie has a missing or empty string we expect your view to hide that particular UI element
 - Loading and error states are not a requirement
